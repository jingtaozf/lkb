This is a highly artifical grammar that is intended to be used to test
various aspects of the morphology system.  The main interest is in the
various inflr-*.tdl files, which are not mutually compatible.  This script 
is intended to be called with the global variable *infl-variant* set
in order to load whichever set of rules is appropriate.  See testing.lisp
