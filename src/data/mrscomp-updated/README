This is an updated version of the mrscomp grammar, which is in line
with the dmrscomp grammar, so the treatments can be compared directly.
The two grammars are identical apart from types.tdl, which contains
the different encodings of the semantics.  Please see the dmrscomp README for further information.

*** Please keep this grammar in line with dmrscomp if you make any modifications to it! ***
