Gpred is for `grammar' predicates: these have to be enumerated in the SEM-I,
but much too frequent for the DTD.

I am not sure that Realpred should be empty - possibly the lemma
should be an element rather than an attribute

Note that the LKB code does not treat pred case as significant - the only
place where case is respected is string-valued arguments (CARG and ??)

POS - now lowercase and obligatory
(v|n|j|r|p|q|x|u)
v - verb
n - noun
j - adjective
r - adverb
p - preposition
q - quantifier (needs to be distinguished for scoping code)
x - other closed class
u - unknown

Labels are always implicitly of the same sort (i.e., label)

Var is the old arg: the list of attributes must be determined by the
Matrix/SEM-I, so the current list is still preliminary

Note that the reason for not making vids be IDs in the XML sense is two-fold:
a) it's too much hassle to ensure uniqueness in a document
b) this isn't supported in RELAX NG - argument is this is the sort of thing
that's part of the semantics, not the syntax, which I tend to agree with -
there's lots of things that have to be checked outside the DTD anyway

Rargnames should be enumerated in the SEM-I, but I don't propose to do this in
the DTD

cfrom and cto are on eps and rmrs - they might also end up on the other
main elements (in-groups, hcons, rargs).  Having them on preds seems
too restrictive/cumbersome - they should be associated with minimal
information units.

cfrom and cto default to -1 if unknown

I am still not entirely happy with in-groups.
