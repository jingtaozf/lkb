the approach of not connecting the ltop of the determiner and the
label of its relation does not translate into RMRS-RASP because we
need access to the label to connect up the Nbar.  Hence, for now,
pretend that the NP is headed by RULE, so we can disconnect the
label at that point ...

RASP doesn't distinguish between main verb `have' and the auxiliary,
which probably means we can't make `have' semantically empty.
Presumably we have the same issue with `do' (ERG has a contentful `do'
for `do the dishes' etc).  There is also a contentful `be' in the ERG for 
`Abrams is a dog' etc.

Test suite examples:

1. It rained

RASP has no chance of distinguishing expletive `it'

2. Abrams barked 

3. The window opened
   open_v_1 in ERG vs open_v
   (note that `Abrams opened the window' gives `open_v_cause' (ARG1 ARG2)

4. Abrams chased Browne

5. Abrams handed Browne the cigarette 

6. Abrams handed the cigarette to Browne
ARG1, ARG2, ARG3 FIX

7. Abrams bet Browne a cigarette that it rained
8. Abrams knew that it rained
9. Abrams intended to bark 
10. Abrams intended Browne to bark
11. Every cat barked
12. Every cat chased some dog
13. My cat barked
14. It barked
15. The cat chased it
16. The cat chased itself
17. The cat chased one

this is the pronoun `one' (I think) - in RASP it has the same tag as somebody
and everybody - which means we have to treat it as very underspecified

18. Mine barked
19. That opened
20. Cats bark
