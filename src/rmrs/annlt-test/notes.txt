the approach of not connecting the ltop of the determiner and the
label of its relation does not translate into RMRS-RASP because we
need access to the label to connect up the Nbar.  Hence, for now,
pretend that the NP is headed by RULE, so we can disconnect the
label at that point ...

RASP doesn't distinguish between main verb `have' and the auxiliary,
which probably means we can't make `have' semantically empty.
Presumably we have the same issue with `do' (ERG has a contentful `do'
for `do the dishes' etc).  There is also a contentful `be' in the ERG for 
`Abrams is a dog' etc.

Test suite examples:

1. RASP has no chance of distinguishing expletive `it' in `it rains'

3. open_v_1 vs open_v
   (note that `Abrams opened the window' gives `open_v_cause' (ARG1 ARG2)
