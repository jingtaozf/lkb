\usepackage{times} works now

for PDF hyperlinks I am using

\usepackage[dvips]{hyperref}

this works on eon and eoan, but not on turing apparently

To construct pdf

LaTeX as normal
dvips -Ptype1 -file newdoc.dvi > newdoc.ps
distill newdoc.ps (on turing, or eoan, accidentally ...)
web files are on ~aac/WWW
so 
mv newdoc.pdf ~aac/WWW


To print two-up:

pstops '2:0L@.7(9in,-.42in)+1L@.7(9in,4.785in)' newdoc.ps >newdoc2.ps

Remaining (known) problems

Generally missing stuff is indicated by FIX (either as LaTeX comment,
or visible in the text).
