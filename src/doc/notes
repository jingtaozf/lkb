I have tried to

\usepackage{times}

but there are missing fonts

for PDF hyperlinks I am using

\usepackage[dvips]{hyperref}

this works on eon and eoan, but not on turing apparently

To construct pdf

LaTeX as normal
dvips -Ptype1 -file newdoc.dvi > newdoc.ps
distill newdoc.ps (on turing, or eoan, accidentally ...)
web files are on ~aac/WWW


Remaining (known) problems

Generally missing stuff is indicated by FIX (either as LaTeX comment,
or visible in the text).

Downloading and installation instructions have lacuna.
