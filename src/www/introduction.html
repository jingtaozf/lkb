<p>
This interface provides on-line access to the LinGO English Resource Grammar
(ERG).
Using facilities of the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB) grammar engineering
environment, the interface allows you to input one sentence at a time, analyze
it using the ERG, and visualize analysis results in various forms.
</p>
<p>
The on-line version, for the time being, only has access to the hand-built ERG
lexicon (of some ten thousand lexemes, mostly taken from scheduling,
e-commerce, and financial services domains), hence be prepared to accomodate
some vocabulary restrictions, please.
