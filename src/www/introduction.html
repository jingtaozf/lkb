This interface provides on-line access to the 
LinGO English Resource Grammar
(ERG).
Using facilities of the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB) grammar engineering
environment, the allows you to input one sentence at a time, analyze
it using the ERG, and visualize analysis results in various forms.
</p>
<p>
The on-line version, for the time being, only has access to the hand-built ERG
lexicon (of some ten thousand lexemes, mostly taken from scheduling,
e-commerce, and financial services domains), hence be prepared to accomodate
some vocabulary restrictions.  The familiar androgynes Kim and Sandy or
the old HP crew (Abrams, Browne, Chiang, and Devito) are you best guess for
proper names.

This page makes relatively heavy use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (some)
JavaScript; while it should be possible to navigate without JavaScript, for the
CSS to work properly, you will need a modern, HTML 4.0.1 compliant browser
(e.g. Mozilla 1.x, Netscape 7.x, IE 5.x, and derivatives).  Please relay bug
reports and suggestions for improvement back to the LKB developers.
