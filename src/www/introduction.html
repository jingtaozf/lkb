<p>
This interface provides on-line access to the 
<a href="http://lingo.stanford.edu/erg.html">LinGO English Resource Grammar</a>
(ERG).
Using facilities of the (a)
<a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~~aac/lkb.html">Linguistic Knowledge 
Builder</a> (LKB) grammar 
engineering platform, (b) high-efficiency 
<a href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/pet/">PET System</a> parser, 
(c) <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/itsdb/">[incr tsdb()] profiling 
environment</a>, and (d) <a href="http://redwoods.stanford.edu">Redwoods
treebanking</a> tools, the interface allows one to input one 
sentence at a time, analyze it using the ERG, and visualize analysis 
results in various forms. 
</p>
<p>
This on-line version, for the time being, only has access to the hand-built ERG
lexicon (of some ten thousand lexemes, mostly taken from scheduling,
e-commerce, and financial services domains), hence be prepared to accomodate
some vocabulary restrictions.  The familiar androgynes Kim and Sandy or
the old HP crew (Abrams, Browne, Chiang, and Devito) are your best guess for
proper names.
</p>
<p>
The LinGO on-line pages make relatively heavy use of Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) and (some) JavaScript; while it should be possible to navigate without
JavaScript, for the CSS to work properly, you will need a modern, HTML 4.0.1
compliant browser (e.g. Mozilla 1.x, Netscape 7.x, IE 5.x, and derivatives).
Please relay bug reports and suggestions for improvement back to the 
<a href="mailto:lkb-bugs@csli.stanford.edu">LKB developers</a>.
