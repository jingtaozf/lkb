This interface provides on-line access to the 
<a href="http://www.emmtee.net">LOGON</a> Machine Translation demonstrator.
Driving a rich cascade of computational grammars and specialized processing
tools, the interface allows one to input one Norwegian sentence at a time,
subsequently translate it to English in a stepwise fashion, and inspect
intermediate results at varying levels of detail.

<p>
This proof-of-concept demonstrator implements a &lsquo;deep&rsquo; linguistic
approach to machine translation between Norwegian and English, where a given
source-language input is analyzed into an abstract, logical-form semantics
(using Minimal Recursion Semantics; MRS); 
which is subsequently transferred into a target-language semantic form; 
which in turn is used for full, grammar-based generation of the English 
system output.
The approach capitalizes on translation quality and precision, rather than on
broadest possible coverage or robustness.
At its current development stage, the system only has access to a
limited vocabulary (specifically in generation) and relatively small set of
correspondence rules between source and target language structures at the
transfer level.
Therefore, choose your input carefully and inspect intermediate results (the
probably most interesting aspect of the demonstration) with great care for
details.  The LOGON target domain is on hiking instructions and general
tourist information.
Clicking the &lsquo;<i>Sample</i>&rsquo; button will activate a random
selection from the LOGON target corpus of some 5,000 sentences.

<p>
The LOGON on-line pages make relatively heavy use of Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) and (some) JavaScript; while it should be possible to navigate without
JavaScript, for the CSS to work properly, you will need a modern, HTML 4.0.1
compliant browser (e.g. Mozilla 1.x, Netscape 7.x, IE 5.x, and derivatives).
Please relay bug reports and suggestions for improvement back to the 
<a href="mailto:maintainers@emmtee.net">LOGON developers</a>.
