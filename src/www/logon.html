This interface provides on-line access to the 
<a href="http://www.emmtee.net">LOGON</a> Baby MT system.
Using facilities of the (a)
<a href="http://www.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/xle/">Xerox Linguistic 
Environment</a> (XLE) LFG System, (b) 
<a href="http://www.ling.uib.no/~~victoria/NorGram/">NorGram</a> computational
grammar of Norwegian, (c) LOGON Transfer Engine, (d) Norwegian &ndash; English
transfer grammar (NoEn), (d) 
<a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~~aac/lkb.html">Linguistic Knowledge 
Builder</a> (LKB) generator, (e) 
<a href="http://lingo.stanford.edu/erg.html">LinGO English Resource Grammar</a>
(ERG), and (f) <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/itsdb/">[incr tsdb()] profiling environment</a>, the interface allows one to input one Norwegian
sentence at a time and subsequently translate it to English in a stepwise
fashion.

<p>
This baby demonstrator implements a &lsquo;deep&rsquo; linguistic approach to
machine
translation between Norwegian and English, where a given source-language input
is analyzed into an abstract, logical-form semantics (using Minimal Recursion
Semantics; MRS); which is subsequently transferred into a target-language
semantic form; which in turn is used for full, grammar-based generation of the
English system output.
The approach capitalizes on translation quality and precision, rather than
coverage or robustness.
At the current early development stage, the system only has access to a
limited vocabulary (specifically in generation) and fairly small set of
correspondence rules between source and target language structures at the
transfer level.
Therefore, choose your input carefully and inspect intermediate results (the
probably most interesting aspect of the demonstration) with great care for
details.  The LOGON target domain is on hiking instructions and general
tourist information.

<p>
The LOGON on-line pages make relatively heavy use of Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) and (some) JavaScript; while it should be possible to navigate without
JavaScript, for the CSS to work properly, you will need a modern, HTML 4.0.1
compliant browser (e.g. Mozilla 1.x, Netscape 7.x, IE 5.x, and derivatives).
Please relay bug reports and suggestions for improvement back to the 
<a href="mailto:bugs@emmtee.net">LOGON developers</a>.
