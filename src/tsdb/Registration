Aiming for a commonly-accepted (pre-standard) diagnostic and evaluation
methodology and technology, wide dissemination and assessment of the 
[incr tsdb()] package is most desirable.  Thus, the software (in source code)
and data are made available to the general public, free of royalties, under
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

To provide feedback on the distribution of the package, [incr tsdb()] users
are encouraged to register (see below) and relay comments, bug reports, or
suggestion for improvement to the contact address given below.  

As part of the installation or at a later time (e.g. once you found the
package to be useful for your purposes), it is recommended that you register
with the author.  Registration is not intended to restrict distribution or
application of the software, to charge users a license fee, or turn a profit
from the sale of a large customer database.  The main and only purpose of
voluntary registration is to provide feedback to the author and to allow
(occasional) relaying of information to the actual users; unless otherwise
requested, registered users will be added to the [incr tsdb()] maling list.
The maling list is used by the author to announce major version upgrades as
they become available; it is very low traffic.
