50170@@@@-1@-1@@The weather in the mountains is capricious and changing, so it is a question of being prepared for most eventualities.@@@-1@@
50170@@@@-1@-1@@Mountain weather is subject to sudden change, so it is necessary to prepare for any eventuality.@@@-1@@
50180@@@@-1@-1@@You should expect rain and wind, and even of a summer day, it can snow.@@@-1@@

50180@@@@-1@-1@@Rain and wind should be expected, and even a summer day may bring snow.@@@-1@@
50190@@@@-1@-1@@So it's always necessary to take along warm clothes and good water-repellent and windproof garments whenever you intend to go on longer hikes in the high mountains.@@@-1@@
50190@@@@-1@-1@@Therefore it is always necessary to take along a change of warm clothing and potable water - as well as a windbreaker when you are planning to make a lengthy trip in the high mountains.@@@-1@@
50190@@@@-1@-1@@So you need to carry a dry change of clothes and adequately waterproof and windproof outerwear on your mountain hikes.@@@-1@@
50200@@@@-1@-1@@And not least something decent to have on your feet.@@@-1@@
50200@@@@-1@-1@@And high quality footwear is a must.@@@-1@@

50210@@@@-1@-1@@Good footwear is half the hike.@@@-1@@
50210@@@@-1@-1@@Good footwear is half the trip.@@@-1@@
50210@@@@-1@-1@@Good boots are essential.@@@-1@@

50220@@@@-1@-1@@In the summer they are probably your most important equipment, so choose them with care.@@@-1@@
50230@@@@-1@-1@@For most people, it's best to rely on decent leather boots, particularly in as demanding terrain as in the Jotunheimen.@@@-1@@

50230@@@@-1@-1@@For most of us sturdy leather boots will be the best choice, especially in the demanding terrain of Jotunheimen.@@@-1@@
50240@@@@-1@-1@@Good boots provide support for your legs and good grip on the ground.@@@-1@@
50240@@@@-1@-1@@Good boots provide support for the legs and good friction against the ground.@@@-1@@

50280@@@@-1@-1@@Even though the course they plan to take is not especially dry, or the terrain is not particularly easy to hike, they choose sneakers.@@@-1@@

50290@@@@-1@-1@@If you have strong legs and aren't reluctant to walk wet the whole day, of course that may be a solution.@@@-1@@
50290@@@@-1@-1@@If you have strong legs and are not afraid of hiking around with wet feet all day long, this of course is a choice you can make.@@@-1@@
