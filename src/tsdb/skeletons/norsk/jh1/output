14650@@@@-1@-1@@Besides, next highest can be debated - when the first ascenders were on Glittertind, the summit snow dome was considerably higher than in our day, so it's entirely possible that the summit was then higher than Galdhøpiggen, even though at that time Galdhøpigg also had a summit glacier.@@@-1@@
14650@@@@-1@-1@@The term next tallest might be open to debate, however - when the first climbers conquered Glittertind, the crown of snow was considerably higher than in modern times, and it is very possible that the peak at that time was actually taller than Galdhøpiggen, even though Galdhøpiggen in those days also had a glacier crown.@@@-1@@
14650@@@@-1@-1@@"Second highest" is debatable, however. Since the ice cap was considerably thicker back then, it is rather likely that the summit was higher than Galdhøpiggen, even if the latter also had a glacier at the time.@@@-1@@
