2071@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@and because it is not a strain, we should consider our departure time and make it something reasonable.@1@18@@oe@9-9-1999
2072@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@it is, pretty, unless you want to do a lunch time meeting, on the seventh of October.@1@17@@oe@9-9-1999
2073@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@if you do not have, mornings on the twenty seventh or the twenty eighth, it looks like my weeks are pretty full.@1@22@@oe@9-9-1999
2074@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@we will be in the office, probably about nine o'clock, maybe ten if we can strain that a little bit,@1@20@@oe@9-9-1999
2075@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@oh, we are in luck for scheduling our departures, from Hanover because there are more flights in the evening.@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2076@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I think we should, get together, some time, as soon as possible, to talk about some things that, you brought up in the meeting.@1@24@@oe@9-9-1999
2077@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@and the most expensive one is two eighteen which is the hotel Cristal, which just has a sauna.@1@18@@oe@9-9-1999
2078@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I am going to take a, rather long vacation, from Wednesday to Friday, and make a long weekend of it.@1@20@@oe@9-9-1999
2079@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@well, I believe someone does not want us to get together, because, from the seventh to the ninth, I am, out of town,@1@23@@oe@9-9-1999
2080@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I don't have a good grasp on what it is the Hanovarians are into, but I do like opera.@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2081@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I believe it is imperative, that we meet sometime as, soon as possible, excepting this week, because I am on vacation.@1@21@@oe@9-9-1999
2082@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@boy that is too bad, because, I am out of town, on business, from the nineteenth, through the twenty first.@1@20@@oe@9-9-1999
2083@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I think if you are going to see live opera my friends who sing opera in Pittsburgh go to Germany to perform sometimes.@1@23@@oe@9-9-1999
2084@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@that is my, first day back in town and I know it will probably be pretty hectic for me,@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2085@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@okay. I have got some things planned for Monday and Tuesday. but I don't have anything on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.@1@21@@oe@9-9-1999
2086@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@from Pittsburgh to Hanover, there are flights for every three hours from six in the morning to five thirty in the afternoon.@1@22@@oe@9-9-1999
2087@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@and then we will have to figure out where we are going to stay, while we are in Hanover.@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2088@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@if you want to meet, as soon as possible, tomorrow morning, the sixth of April, is good for me.@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2089@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@and then the hotel at the Georgengarten is the most expensive where a single room is a hundred and eighty six Euros.@1@22@@oe@9-9-1999
2090@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@that is only five minutes from the central station, has a bar, a restaurant and a parking garage,@1@18@@oe@9-9-1999
2091@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@the week of the nineteenth is, fairly busy for me too, although I do have, some blocks of time, available, for a meeting.@1@23@@oe@9-9-1999
2092@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@well, I have a concert to attend on the sixteenth but I guess I can reschedule that, too.@1@18@@oe@9-9-1999
2093@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@so if we are going to be able to meet that, last week in January, it is going have to be the, twenty fifth,@1@24@@oe@9-9-1999
2094@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@so if you can not meet on the twenty sixth at all, in the afternoon, maybe after three o'clock, then maybe we should start looking at the first week in February,@1@31@@oe@9-9-1999
2095@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@there is a flight for every four hours from eight in the morning to eight in the evening.@1@18@@oe@9-9-1999
2096@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@that way we will have spent a half a day there on Wednesday and that would have given us the one and a half days that we need for the business trip.@1@32@@oe@9-9-1999
2097@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@yeah, like I said, I am out, at noon, so, do you want to meet from, three to five?@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2098@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@yeah, why don't we just, put it at the end of the day, and, go, from three to five.@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2099@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@okay, great. then I will call the hotel and make the reservations if you will call the airline and reserve the plane tickets.@1@23@@oe@9-9-1999
2100@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@if we are looking at, the, last full week in May, the only days I have, are the twenty fourth, and the twenty fifth,@1@24@@oe@9-9-1999
2101@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I am getting ready to go out of town, on the thirty first, so I have been leaving that open just just for such an occasion,@1@26@@oe@9-9-1999
2102@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I was trying to avoid this, because I am out of town until, the second of June, and we really need to meet, before the fifth,@1@26@@oe@9-9-1999
2103@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I am free on that Thursday and Friday. so maybe we could fly out on Wednesday, the third of March?@1@20@@oe@9-9-1999
2104@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@so for the flight information, it leaves every four hours from six in the morning until ten in the evening.@1@20@@oe@9-9-1999
2105@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@well, I could do the lunch meeting on Friday but I would rather not, leave it until the last day,@1@20@@oe@9-9-1999
2106@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@@Hanover to Pittsburgh, there is flight for every three hours from five in the morning until five in the afternoon.@0@20@@oe@9-9-1999
2107@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@well, the twenty eighth, after noon is bad for me, and, so is the twenty ninth, in the morning,@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2108@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@then I will call the hotel and make the reservation there for two single rooms. and can you take care of the airline tickets?@1@24@@oe@9-9-1999
2109@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@S@I do not know, where your meeting is, or where you need to come from, so you tell me,@1@19@@oe@9-9-1999
2110@VerbMobil@formal@none@1@@probably the best we would be able to handle on that week, because I leave on, I leave on a Friday.@0@21@@oe@9-9-1999
