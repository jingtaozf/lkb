2345@unknown@formal@none@1@S@I am busy all day on the twenty ninth, but the thirtieth, I have a meeting at ten o'clock, so, if you would like, we could, schedule it, like maybe around eight o'clock.@1@33@@oe@17-5-2000
2346@unknown@formal@none@1@S@so I will not be able to, really make it during the morning and you said you were all full, during the afternoon, so, Tuesday I guess is the only option for, beforehand,@1@33@@oe@17-5-2000
2347@unknown@formal@none@1@S@okay, on Saturday I am playing tennis with Linda, you know the hot blonde, from eleven to one, but, I do not know what I am going to be doing with her later.@1@33@@oe@17-5-2000
2348@unknown@formal@none@1@@and, the times that, I would have free, coming up, would be on the twenty fifth, in the morning, twenty seventh in the afternoon, February third, in the afternoon, and that is about it,@0@34@@oe@17-5-2000
2349@unknown@formal@none@1@S@well, I have an hour and a half free between eleven and, twelve thirty, but I tend not to like, you know, meetings that are kind of under pressure to get to other places.@1@34@@oe@17-5-2000
2350@unknown@formal@none@1@S@well, I will be out of town on the days you mentioned and it does not appear that our schedules will coincide the first week if you have no free time the first week.@1@34@@oe@17-5-2000
2351@unknown@formal@none@1@XP@and then, you know, we would have time in the city maybe on Monday and then we would be able to meet with our affiliates Tuesday and Wednesday and then leave Wednesday night or Thursday.@1@35@@oe@17-5-2000
2352@unknown@formal@none@1@S@well, from Hanover to Pittsburgh it is every four hours from eight o'clock to eight o'clock and the last flight is at eleven thirty five and the duration of the flight would take twelve hours.@1@35@@oe@17-5-2000
2353@unknown@formal@none@1@S@I guess we could do it, and it is no big deal, but, on either Tuesday, the, twenty third or the thirtieth it would be a lot better because I do not have class until ten.@1@36@@oe@17-5-2000
2354@unknown@formal@none@1@S@well I am afraid I am busy, all afternoon that Thursday, so if you move all the way to the fourth of August, I am free in the afternoon there, or the morning of the fifth.@1@36@@oe@17-5-2000
2355@unknown@formal@none@1@S@I have got a, trip next week, over to Florida and, I would really really like to, get some kind of meeting set up with you before that, to discuss a, few ideas I have had.@1@36@@oe@17-5-2000
2356@unknown@formal@none@1@@I am sorry that my schedule wasn't a bit more tightly packed the weekend of the the eighteenth because I have got the conference on the nineteenth. and I have a staff meeting Monday through Thursday.@0@36@@oe@17-5-2000
2357@unknown@formal@none@1@S@I am dreadfully sorry but, from two, to four thirty, I have got a meeting, on the twenty eighth, and on, Thursday the twenty ninth, I am busy the entire morning, because I have got a lecture.@1@37@@oe@17-5-2000
2358@unknown@formal@none@1@S@well on the twenty ninth, I am, busy, from nine , to two thirty, and then on the thirtieth, I am busy from nine, until about three, but, on that day I am free between eleven o'clock and two o'clock.@1@40@@oe@17-5-2000
2359@unknown@formal@none@1@S@the, thirty first would be the day that I go out of town and I, will not be back until the Thursday which would be the third of June, and I have got a meeting from ten until eleven A-M.@1@40@@oe@17-5-2000
2360@unknown@formal@none@1@S@so, if the flight is twelve hours and we figure on getting there early in the morning on Thursday, let us say we want to get there like seven o'clock in the morning on Thursday, then that is six hours back,@1@41@@oe@17-5-2000
2361@unknown@formal@none@1@S@well, my afternoon of Friday the first looks pretty horrible, and the other only two days in business hours, the seventh and eighth I am tied up, pretty much all day, so it looks like we may have to move this to the weekend.@1@44@@oe@17-5-2000
2362@unknown@formal@none@1@S@if you, can live with a short meeting then maybe we can do it then, otherwise , I think we are going to have to wind up doing it in the morning or, early morning like eight o'clock some day or, in the early evening.@1@45@@oe@17-5-2000
2363@unknown@formal@none@1@S@if we were to leave at six o'clock on Wednesday, six o'clock in the evening, we would arrive twelve hours later, at six o'clock in the morning on Thursday, but would actually be six hours behind because of the time difference, so we would actually arrive at twelve o'clock midnight.@1@50@@oe@17-5-2000
