10702140@unknown@formal@none@1@S@One of the most pervasive is the use of acute accents in the European/African/Asian orthography in many words such as ''sinónimo'', where the Brazilian orthography has a circumflex accent, ''sinônimo''.@1@30@@oe@30-11-2008
10702150@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Another important difference is that Brazilian spelling often lacks ''c'' or ''p'' before ''c'', ''ç'', or ''t'', where the European orthography has them; for example, cf.
