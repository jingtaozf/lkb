# packages, specifically:
#
# - the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB)
# - the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG)
# - the Grammar Matrix, a grammar development starter kit
# - the [incr tsdb()] (aka `tee ess dee bee plus plus') profiler
#
# others (e.g. PET, maybe more grammars) to follow.  for now, this is a rough
# script intended to give people an idea of how to do an installation; i have
# mostly tested it on Linux and Solaris, although Windoze plus the open-source
# CygWin package (a Un*x-like add-on set of tools for Windoze) should work.
